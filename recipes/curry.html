    <h1>Curry</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Japanese curry is a thick curry with a stew-like consistency and commonly includes a protein, sweet onions, carrots, and potatoes. The sauce is thickened by a roux (a mixture of fat and flour, and an addition of curry spices). </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>¼ tsp kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 carrots</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>3 Yukon gold potatoes</li>
        <li>1 knob ginger</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>½ apple</li>
        <li>1½ Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, rice bran, canola, etc.)</li>
        <li>4 cups Chicken Stock/Broth (homemade or store bought)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp honey</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp ketchup</li>
        <li>1 package Japanese curry roux</li>
        <li>2-4 tsp kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients. </li>
        <li>Cut the onions into wedges.</li>
        <li>Peel the carrots and cut them into rolling wedges (it's called rangiri in Japanese). </li>
        <li>Peel the potatoes. Cut each potato into quarters (6 pieces for russet potatoes). Soak them in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch.</li>
        <li>Grate the ginger (I use this grater). You will need 1 tsp of grated ginger, including the juice. Mince the garlic and set aside (I use a garlic press later when adding to the pot).</li>
        <li>Cut the apple into quarters, remove the core, and peel the skin.</li>
        <li>Grate the apple. My apple today is a lunchbox apple (smaller than regular), so I used the entire apple (yielded ½ cup or 120 ml grated apple). If your apple is regular size, use ½-¾ apple.</li>
        <li>Cut off the extra fat from the chicken and discard it. Then cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. I recommend cutting it diagonally (it's called sogigiri in Japanese) to create more surface area and flatten each piece so it cooks faster. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat and add the onion.</li>
        <li>Sauté the onions, stirring occasionally, until they become translucent and tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic (I pass it through a garlic press for a finer texture) and grated ginger and mix well together.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until it's no longer pink on the outside. If the onions are getting too brown, reduce the heat to medium low temporarily.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken stock</li>
        <li>Add the grated apple, honey, soy sauce, and ketchup (or any condiment you choose to add). Please read my blog post for details.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots and potatoes. The broth should barely cover the ingredients. Don't worry; we don't want too much liquid here, and additional liquid will be released from the meat and vegetables.</li>
        <li>Simmer, covered*, on medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. *Simmer uncovered if the ingredients are completely submerged in the broth.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, use a fine-mesh strainer to skim the scum and foam from the surface of the broth.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook covered until a wooden skewer goes through the carrots and potatoes.</li>
    </ol>
